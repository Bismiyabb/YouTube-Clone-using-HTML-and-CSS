# YouTube Clone Using HTML and CSS
This project is a simplified clone of YouTube, created using only HTML and CSS.   
The goal of this project is to replicate the basic layout and design of YouTube's homepage,  
focusing on the front-end structure without any backend or JavaScript functionality.

## Features:  
- Navigation Bar: A fully functional top navigation bar that includes a YouTube logo, search bar, and icons for video uploads, notifications, and user profile access.
- Sidebar Menu: A sidebar containing links to popular sections such as Home, Subscriptions, and more. The sidebar is collapsible on smaller screens.  
- Video Thumbnails: Display of multiple video thumbnails in a grid layout, similar to YouTube's homepage. Each thumbnail includes a preview image, video title, channel name, and view count.
